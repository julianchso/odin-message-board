## About The Project

### [Live Demo (TBD)](TBD)

_(ctrl+click link above to open in new window)_

This app is a messaging board where users can type in username and message. It is a mini-full stack app with nodeJS as the backend and react as the frontend. It taught me how to create a backend API that can communicate with the frontend. As it was my first time creating an API, a silly mistake I made was running the backend on localhost:3000, stopping it to run the frontend on localhost:5173, and wondering why I was getting an axios 404 network error. I was not aware that I could run both the backend and frontend in VS Code at the same time! Spent two days on this silly error...

One feature I'm proud of is using the data-fns library that allows me to show how long ago the message was sent with the time updating every x seconds without the need to refresh the page.

I also used TailwindCSS for the first time and I think I like it more than Bootstrap due to Tailwind's customization.

### Features

- Message board where users can type in username and message

### Features to Come (and hurdles to overcome and possible solutions)!

- Storing data in a database (mongoose/MongoDB) instead of an array that refreshes.
